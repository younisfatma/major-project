# Proposal
I will continue making my previous game better. It is a knoke off version of Agario. 


## Needs To Have
- a better start screen, where you choose your sprite at the begining
- player name above the player
- a restart button
- different sized food, that make you grow differently depending on the size (food as an object)
- auto matically generated obsticals that are sprites
- make food collision 


## Nice To Have
- a map
- some sort of point system
- other "players"
