# Proposal
I will continue working on my previous game and add improvements.


## Needs To Have
- ~~ different sized food, that make you grow differently depending on the size (food as an object) ~~
- automatically generated obsticals that are sprites (object) 
- ~~ make food collision ~~
- a better start screen, where you choose your sprite at the begining
- player name above the player
- ~~ a restart button ~~
 
## Nice To Have
- a map
- some sort of point system
- other "players"
