# Proposal
I will continue working on my previous game and add improvements.


## Needs To Have
- ~~different sized food, that make you grow differently depending on the size (food as an object)~~
-  ~~obsticals (object)~~ 
- ~~make food collision~~
- a better start screen, where you choose your sprite at the begining
- player name above the player
- ~~a restart button~~

 
## Nice To Have
- a map
- some sort of point system
- other "players"
- background music
- sound when food is eaten
