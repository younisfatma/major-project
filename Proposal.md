# Proposal
I will continue working on my previous game and add improvements.

## Needs To Have
- ~~different sized food, that make you grow differently depending on the size (food as an object)~~
-  ~~obsticals (object)~~ 
- ~~make food collision~~
- ~~a better start screen, where you choose your sprite at the begining~~
- ~~player name above the player~~
- ~~a restart button~~
 
## Nice To Have
- background music //thursday
- sound when food is eaten //thursday
- ~~some sort of point system~~
- a map //wed && friday
- other "players"




## notes
  // Makes background Scroll
  image(ocean,0 , y1, 700, 650);
  image(ocean,0 , y2, 700, 650);
  y1 += backgroundConstant;
  y2 += backgroundConstant;
  if (y1 >= 650) {
    y1 = -600;
  }
  if (y2 >= 650) {
    y2 = -600;
  }
}
