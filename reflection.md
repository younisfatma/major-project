# Major Project reflection

## Did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?
Yes, my needs to have list was relatively easy to complete.
The logic was already there and I just needed to write the code

## Hardest part of project
The hardest part of the project was the map.
I spent most of my time reading through other projects but the way they did theirs wasn't compatiable with my game.
So, I wasted a bit of time trying to figure that out. 
After I figured out that all I needed to do was move the other objects and not the player it made things easier.
However, I was unable to figure out barriers for the game and the player can move around infinately.
 ## Another problem
 Another problem I faced was the collision detection. It would sometimes detect collisions when the object werent 
 colliding. The solution was fairely simple. I made the mode of all the objects center and it worked.
 
 ## Conclusion
 Other than a few minor problems, the making of this project went smoothly. If I were to do this project again
 I would spend more time on the graphics of the game and I would tell myself that making the map is not as hard as I made it seem.
 I would also spend more time imporving the graphics of the game
 and make it look "cooler".
